# Quick Start Guide - Test Suite

## Running Tests

```bash
npm start
```

## Adjusting Log Verbosity

Edit the `.env` file and change the `LOG_LEVEL` setting:

### For Clean Output (Recommended) ‚ú®
```env
LOG_LEVEL=info
```
**Best for:** Daily development, monitoring test results

**Output:** Key milestones and results only
```
‚úÖ Dashboard loaded
‚è± COLD login took: 15.438s
üìä Results: Cold: 6.596s, Warm: 4.758s (27.9% improvement)
```

### For Troubleshooting üîç
```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
**Best for:** When tests fail and you need more detail

**Output:** Detailed execution flow with all major steps

### For Deep Debugging üêõ
```env
LOG_LEVEL=verbose
```
**Best for:** Understanding exact timing and escalation behavior

**Output:** Everything including timeout escalations and network requests

### For CI/CD Pipelines ü§ñ
```env
LOG_LEVEL=silent
```
**Best for:** Automated runs where you only need results

**Output:** Only test results and errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "element click intercepted"

## Log Level Cheat Sheet

| Level | What You See |
|-------|-------------|
| `silent` | Results only |
| `error` | Errors only |
| `warn` | Errors + Warnings |
| **`info`** | **Key events (default)** ‚≠ê |
| `debug` | Detailed steps |
| `verbose` | Everything |

## Tips

1. **Start with `info`** - It's the sweet spot for most use cases
2. **Switch to `debug` when troubleshooting** - Gives you detail without overwhelming
3. **Use `verbose` only when you need timing details** - Shows all timeout escalations
4. **Set to `silent` for reports** - Clean output for CI/CD

## Test Results Location

Results are automatically saved to:
- `results/results-normal.csv` - Normal workflow tests
- `results/results-cold.csv` - Cold cache tests
- `results/results-warm.csv` - Warm cache tests
- `results/results-cache-comparison.csv` - Cache comparison analysis
